# Canny-Edge-Detector
System-on-Chip Design
This report contains case study about an edge detect program and how to modelized the source code into a system step by step. 
It also includes some analysis about the performance of the system by using SoC environment and how to utilize the evaluation 
to improve the design of the system. The goal of this project is to build a real-time edge detect system from video camera.
